== Welcome to the HackClass Academy

A collection of repositories of open source code & challenges for developers interesting in improving our craft.

== Overview

# User collects a resource that is a repo they find useful for understanding good code

# Learning resources (repos) are shared with the HackClass Academy community

# Users in community can favorite these resources. 

# The more favorites a resource has, the higher it ranks for overall usefulness in a list view (which is the primary way users find vetted repos)

# Users can comment in three ways:

## Users can share the type of comment where they are stating what they've learned from the resource

## Users can share the type of comment where they are asking questions about code within the resource they don't understand

## Users can comment in response to either prior type of comment, engaging in a conversation about what they've learned or what they don't yet understand

# Users can +1 all types of comments.

== That's it for MVP.

== Future Roadmap

# If there is traction, add a web based console where uses can execute the code from the repo + practice variations on the code right there on the site (within reason)

== Message

# It's saying "There is an oasis of knowledge here." and letting fellow devs, novice to pro, know about it.
